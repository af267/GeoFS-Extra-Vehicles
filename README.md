# GeoFS Extra Vehicles
Extra vehicles in GeoFS presented by JXT. This addon includes extra vehicles such as the MD-11, food service truck, IL-76, and the Northtech RADIO (April Fools UFO).

Current Version: 1.2.4

Developer: AF267 (Discord: af267)

## How To Use
1. **Tampermonkey (best for PC/laptop):** Via the Tampermonkey Chrome extension (https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en&pli=1), copy and paste main.js into a new script. It should automatically run when you open GeoFS.
2. **Copy and Paste (easiest):** Directly copying and pasting main.js into the GeoFS console will also run the script.
3. **Bookmarking (best for mobile):** Copy the bookmarklet.js script into the new bookmark added. See 1:30 of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfpHJudRFko
